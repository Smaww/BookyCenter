## *The Magic Button for All Your Daily Bookings*

**Version:** 1.0 | **Date:** February 7, 2026

## 1. The Big Idea 💡

### What is Booky Center?

**Booky Center is like a magic button on your phone.** One tap, and you can book anything you need in your daily life—a football pitch, a haircut, a plumber, or a birthday party venue.

Think of it this way:

| Before Booky (The Big Mess) | After Booky (The Magic Shelf) |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| You search on Facebook for hours | Everything is organized in one app |
| You send 10 DMs asking "price?" | All prices are shown clearly |
| You call and no one answers | You see available times instantly |
| You show up and it's double-booked | Your slot is guaranteed |
| You only have cash | Pay by card, Vodafone Cash, or cash |

### Our Simple Goal

**We want to take all the scattered services in Egypt—from barbers to birthday halls—and put them on one organized shelf.** No more hunting. No more guessing. Just tap and book.
